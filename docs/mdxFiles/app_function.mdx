Registered users can log in to their accounts using their email address and password. Authentication is securely handled using Firebase Authentication.

Users can browse products by category using a navigation menu that allows them to explore various departments such as electronics, clothing, home goods, and more.

### Product Search

A search bar at the top of the screen enables users to search for specific products by entering keywords. Search results are displayed in real-time as users type.

### Product Details

Tapping on a product from the search results or category listings opens a detailed product page with images, descriptions, pricing information, customer reviews, and related products.

## Shopping Cart
